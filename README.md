anvil.insult-generator
======================
This is an insult generator for anvil.js.  

To use it, simply add a `task` directory to your root project, and an `insult` directory in there.  

Then clone this repository to it and run...

```bash
npm install
```

Then you'll be insulted every time you build... Like...
